In this project we will analyze the different rates of violence (adding violent and non-violent crimes), throughout the United States.

The periods analyzed range from 2013 to 2018, the source from which the data has been obtained is through a kaggle dataset offered by the FBI, publicly available and free.

The tool used is Tableau (for data visualization and mapping), pandas and numpy were used on python to do the data cleaning, finally the result is six maps of the US, with a visualization of their crime rates.

Also on the first slide we can see a ranking of the different states that make up the US in a way that reflects the states from highest to lowest according to their crime rates.

I offer a linear graph to check the crime trend in the period analyzed, if we turn to press sources and news we can see that the drug war, among other causes within the territory, has subjected the country to an increase in crimes in the time and a larger area of ​​states affected by this issue.

Thank you very much for your interest.

Cheers,
